# React + Vite NBA Team Builder App

## Jack Rellinger, Danny Mikolay

Notes on the nba_api python block in backend:
- Tried to use nba_api from github to create a more robust player dataset with historical players
- Encountered multiple issues when using the api repeatedly, resulted in failure after ~ 100 calls
- Tried multiple workarounds, defaulted back to our static original players.json 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
